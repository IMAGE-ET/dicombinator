dicombinator
============

DICOMbinator was created over a 24 hour period for the SXSW Interactive Hackathon. It was selected as a winner of the competition. 

DICOMbinator is a web-based application that allows users to view and annotate DICOM medical images through an intuitive interface. Comments and visual annotations are pushed to other users instantly, facilitating real-time communication. This tool can enhance collaboration and learning in the fields of health and education, giving professionals and educators the ability to share and discuss medical scans with large groups of people. DICOMbinator was written in Javascript with a Node.js back-end utilizing WebSockets.
